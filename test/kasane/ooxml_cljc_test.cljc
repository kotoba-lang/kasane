  "kasane.normalize/ooxml->doc against real docx/xlsx/pptx fixtures (pandoc

   because openpyxl defaults to inline strings, but ooxml->doc's xlsx path
   reads xl/sharedStrings.xml, which only xlsxwriter's default output has).

   Unlike kasane.ooxml-test (.clj, JVM-only -- its fixtures are built at
   test time via java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream, a writer with no portable
   equivalent anywhere in this dependency graph), this ns is .cljc: the
   fixtures are pre-built real files committed as resources, unzipped via
   org-pkware-zip's zip.core/parse (a portable *reader*, already a kasane
   :test dep) instead of generated at test time. That sidesteps the
   \"no portable zip writer\" limitation entirely -- this is the first time
   kasane's OOXML integration has ever run under the actual nbb/cljs
   runtime (test/run.cljs previously excluded ooxml coverage altogether)."
