  "Portable (:clj / :cljs-via-nbb) resource loading for kasane's test suite.
   :clj uses clojure.java.io/resource (JVM classpath). :cljs (run under nbb,
   ClojureScript-on-Node — see CLAUDE.md's `.cljc`/`.kotoba` runtime priority
   order, nbb ranks above plain JVM) has no classpath/resource-loader
   concept, so it reads resources/-relative paths directly via node:fs.
   This means nbb-run tests must be invoked with the kasane repo root as
   cwd (both `clojure -M:test` and the nbb invocation documented in
   README.md already assume this)."
